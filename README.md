# Phonetic Search in Haskell

This project implements a basic phonetic matching algorithm in Haskell, designed to group similar-sounding names together. It was built as a functional programming exercise and explores string processing, recursion, and pattern matching.

The program processes a list of names and applies character groupings and phonetic simplifications to find close matches.
