# Phonetic Search in Haskell

This project implements a basic phonetic matching algorithm in Haskell, designed to group similar-sounding names together. The program processes a list of names and applies character groupings and phonetic simplifications to find close matches.

This was originally developed for the Declarative Programming module (CS-205) at Swansea University.
